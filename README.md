# It's Pong Game!
The Online Pong game server with Golang.


A mini pong game server that support multiplayer online, Motivation at the beginning is to learn and practice multip IO connection and Golang language.

If you are interested in the client side, you can visit this [Link](https://github.com/ShawnSWu/PongOnlineGameClient)

The Start button is currently unavailable, I'm sorry for this, I want to focus on the online game function for this project, I'll add it in the future (maybe).

If you try to play online and the server is not running, please contact me.
